# UncannyStory
A simple interactive fiction system that allows players to point and click between choices, obtain inventory items (flat, string-array inventory), and branch the story based on these items.

Implemented for the Savannah College of Art & Design MFA in Interactive Design & Game Development.  Released under the BSD 3-clause license.

Because of its simplicity it is unlikely that this system is platform dependent, other than maybe "not VR."  If it can use Unity screen-space UI, it can run there.
